# Bookly Flutter Mobile Application

Welcome to the Bookly Flutter Mobile Application repository! ðŸ“šðŸš€

## Overview

Bookly is a mobile application built using Flutter that provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for book enthusiasts. This project was developed as part of my learning journey into the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Bloc pattern, focusing on writing clean, maintainable code and utilizing various Flutter packages.

## Features

- **MVVM Pattern**: The application is structured using the MVVM pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a robust architecture.
- **Bloc Pattern**: Deep dive into the Bloc pattern for state management, ensuring scalable and testable code.
- **Clean Code**: Emphasis on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Package Integration**: Utilizes several powerful Flutter packages to enhance functionality and user experience.

## Packages Used

- `cached_network_image`: Efficiently loads and caches images from the network.
- `dartz`: Functional programming in Dart.
- `get_it`: Simple service locator for managing dependencies.
- `go_router`: Declarative routing for Flutter.
- `url_launcher`: Launch URLs in the mobile platform.
- ...and many others!
